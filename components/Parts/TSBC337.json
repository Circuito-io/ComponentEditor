    "desc": "BJTs are manufactured in two types, NPN and PNP, and are available as individual components, or fabricated in integrated circuits, often in large numbers.<br>The basic function of a BJT is to amplify current. This allows BJTs to be used as amplifiers or switches, giving them wide applicability in electronic equipment,including computers, televisions, mobile phones, audio amplifiers, industrial control, and radio transmitters.",

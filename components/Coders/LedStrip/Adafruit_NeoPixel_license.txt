/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Arduino library to control a wide variety of WS2811- and WS2812-based RGB
  LED devices such as Adafruit FLORA RGB Smart Pixels and NeoPixel strips.
  Currently handles 400 and 800 KHz bitstreams on 8, 12 and 16 MHz ATmega
  MCUs, with LEDs wired for various color orders.  8 MHz MCUs provide
  output on PORTB and PORTD, while 16 MHz chips can handle most output pins
  (possible exception with upper PORT registers on the Arduino Mega).
